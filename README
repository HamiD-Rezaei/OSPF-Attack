Hi.

You can visit my blog for more details about the attack.

Note:
	You must define one LoopBack interface on the R1 router with the following specifications:

IP		:	192.168.200.20
SubnetMask	:	255.255.255.255


In this attack, we will forge a message of R1 router then the rogue message sends to the R2 router and the LoopBack interface enter into the OSPF routing domain.
